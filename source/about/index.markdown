I'm **Ivan Mesic**, programmer (or is it developer?), lecturer,
entrepreneur and a beer-lover from Croatia. I mostly do small project
development, lecture and have fun with my son and wife.


I *love* programming and everything about it and occasionally do
some math. In addition, I like nature and outdoor thingies, but usually
have something techie thing about me.


My programming skills are diverse and I can manage mostly anything:
I have done projects in C, C++, C#, python and php. I can handle LaTeX
typesetting system, can use linux, can use windows and get by with
android devices.

I am always open for work: business apps (from design to production),
process optimization (converting existing processes to computerized
ones), consulting or lecturing.
